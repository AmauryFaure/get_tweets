# get_tweets

This code is made to get some tweet content from tweets of potentially harmful contents. 
Tweets obtained from the code are stored in `potential_tweets.csv` or `potential_tweets_xxx.csv`.

Tweets selected as harmful are stored in `selected_tweets.csv`

This work also uses some tweets from [MLMA hate speech](https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MLMA_hate_speech.git).
